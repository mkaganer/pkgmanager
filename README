This framework is aimed to ease web application development in PHP5. It allows to split your application into separate "packages" with a possibility to manage a separate configuration for each package where user can override a default values supplied by the package code.

User application just "imports" the required packages, supplies a required config values, and the framework is responsible for loading the required classes using autoload techniques.

Contains a database abstraction layer classes, which i find VERY useful :-)

Currently, the framework contains HTML output object model, with a robust template file parser/renderer. Each HTML block contains a tree of "member" elements (nested html_block class instances or raw strings) which can be accessed by a "path" like syntax. HTML package also contains classes to manage 2-way data-binded form elements (Element values are loaded from the corresponding keys of "data" array, and the submitted values are stored back)

Sorry, most of docs are still missing, but many APIs are described in PHPDoc comments and method declarations.
